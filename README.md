# IJython: A Jython Notebook for Jupyter/IPython


##Installation:

1. Install ipython and ipython notebook

2. Get the IJython package either by downloading tar/zip file from this git release or clone this git repository.

3. Go into the package directory and install package by

`python setup.py install`

4. Make sure you have java JRE or set JAVA_HOME environment appropriately.

Download [jython 2.5.2](http://www.jython.org/downloads.html) and set JYTHON_HOME to location where jython.jar exists, **current version of IJython works with jython version 2.5.2, doesnt produce desirable results with version 2.7.0**

Then open a ipython notebook `ipython notebook` and find Jython in list of notebooks to use. Start scripting like in Jython.
